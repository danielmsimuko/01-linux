# 01 - Linux System Administrator 

These are my study notes for the Linux Certified System Administrator/Engineer exam. They comprise of the bulk of the commands I have come across. At a more advanced level, these commands become longer, more complex but more powerful and I will also remove the more basic commands

These notes will be expanded upon as my knowledge bases continues to grow so I hope they provide some value to you. 

See if you know what this command does: 

`$ grep -E -o "\b[A-Za-z0-9._%+-]+@[A-Za-z0-9.-]+\.[A-za-z]{2,6}\b" filename.txt`  

## Basics
These notes assume you are already familiar with Linux and are comfortable enough to at least move between directories. Commands such as `$ cd /dirname` , `$ clear` and `$ exit` are already familiar to you. If not, it would be worth investing time into learning the essentials via the Linux Professional Institutes Essentials Course.
